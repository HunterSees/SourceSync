## System Architecture

### Overview

SyncStream employs a distributed architecture designed to minimize latency while maximizing synchronization accuracy across diverse audio output devices. The system operates on a hub-and-spoke model where a central transmitter host coordinates audio distribution and synchronization control, while individual receiver nodes manage device-specific audio output and provide real-time feedback on synchronization quality.

The architecture is specifically designed to address the inherent challenges of multi-device audio synchronization, including variable network latency, device-specific audio processing delays, and the accumulation of timing drift over extended playback periods. By implementing microphone-based feedback loops at each receiver node, the system can detect and correct synchronization drift in real-time, maintaining audio coherence across all connected devices.

### Core Components

#### Transmitter Host

The transmitter host serves as the central coordination point for the entire SyncStream system. Built to run on more powerful hardware such as a Raspberry Pi 4B or standard PC, the transmitter host manages several critical functions:

**Audio Server Module**: Responsible for capturing audio input from various sources including microphones, line inputs, network streams, or audio files. The audio server implements a circular buffer architecture that maintains a configurable duration of audio data (typically 10-30 seconds) to accommodate varying device latencies and network conditions. The server supports multiple audio formats and sample rates, with automatic conversion capabilities to ensure compatibility across all connected devices.

**Sync Controller**: The heart of the synchronization system, the sync controller processes drift reports from receiver nodes and calculates appropriate buffer offset adjustments. Using advanced algorithms that consider historical drift patterns, correlation quality, and device-specific characteristics, the sync controller maintains optimal synchronization across all devices. The controller implements both reactive correction (responding to detected drift) and predictive adjustment (anticipating drift based on historical patterns).

**MQTT Broker**: Facilitates all communication between the transmitter host and receiver nodes using the MQTT protocol. The broker handles device registration, heartbeat monitoring, drift reporting, and command distribution. MQTT was chosen for its lightweight nature, built-in quality of service guarantees, and excellent support for many-to-one communication patterns typical in IoT deployments.

**Audio Buffer Management**: Maintains synchronized audio buffers that account for the varying latencies of different device types. The buffer management system implements intelligent pre-loading strategies that ensure audio data is available when needed while minimizing memory usage and maintaining real-time performance.

#### Receiver Nodes

Each receiver node operates on a Raspberry Pi Zero W and is responsible for managing audio output to a specific device or group of devices. The receiver nodes implement several sophisticated subsystems:

**Microphone Capture System**: Each receiver node includes a high-quality IÂ²S microphone (such as the INMP441 or SPH0645) that continuously monitors the actual audio output from the connected device. This real-world feedback mechanism is crucial for detecting synchronization drift that may not be apparent through software timing alone. The microphone system implements noise filtering, automatic gain control, and signal conditioning to ensure reliable drift detection even in challenging acoustic environments.

**Drift Detection Engine**: Analyzes the captured microphone audio against the reference audio stream to calculate precise drift measurements. The engine employs cross-correlation algorithms optimized for real-time operation on the limited processing power of the Raspberry Pi Zero W. Advanced signal processing techniques including high-pass filtering, normalization, and correlation peak detection ensure accurate drift measurements even in the presence of acoustic noise and reverberation.

**Audio Output Drivers**: Provide device-specific audio output capabilities supporting multiple ecosystems including Chromecast (via mkchromecast), AirPlay (via shairport-sync), Bluetooth (via PulseAudio), and direct analog output. Each driver implements device-specific optimizations and latency compensation to ensure optimal performance across different hardware platforms.

**MQTT Client**: Maintains persistent communication with the transmitter host, reporting drift measurements, device status, and receiving synchronization commands. The client implements automatic reconnection, message queuing, and error recovery to ensure reliable operation even in challenging network conditions.

#### Control Interface

The control interface provides comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities through both web-based and API interfaces:

**Web Dashboard**: A responsive React-based interface that provides real-time visualization of system status, device performance, and synchronization quality. The dashboard includes interactive charts showing drift trends, device status indicators, and manual control capabilities for fine-tuning synchronization parameters.

**REST API**: A comprehensive Flask-based API that exposes all system functionality for integration with external systems or custom control applications. The API provides endpoints for device management, synchronization control, system monitoring, and configuration management.

**Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket-based real-time updates ensure that the control interface reflects current system status without requiring manual refresh operations. This enables immediate response to synchronization issues and provides operators with the information needed for proactive system management.

### Communication Protocols

#### MQTT Message Schema

SyncStream employs a well-defined MQTT message schema that ensures reliable and efficient communication between system components:

**Topic Structure**: Messages are organized using a hierarchical topic structure that facilitates both device-specific and broadcast communication:
- `syncstream/drift/{device_id}`: Drift reports from individual devices
- `syncstream/buffer_offset/{device_id}`: Buffer offset commands to specific devices
- `syncstream/command/{device_id}`: Device-specific control commands
- `syncstream/command/all`: Broadcast commands to all devices
- `syncstream/status/{device_id}`: Device status updates
- `syncstream/heartbeat/{device_id}`: Device heartbeat messages

**Message Formats**: All messages use JSON encoding with standardized schemas that include timestamp information, message versioning, and error handling capabilities. Message schemas are designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements without breaking compatibility with existing deployments.

**Quality of Service**: The system employs MQTT QoS level 1 (at least once delivery) for critical messages such as synchronization commands and drift reports, while using QoS level 0 (at most once delivery) for high-frequency status updates and heartbeat messages to optimize network utilization.

### Synchronization Algorithm

The core synchronization algorithm represents the culmination of advanced signal processing techniques and distributed systems design principles:

#### Drift Detection

Drift detection operates through continuous cross-correlation analysis between the reference audio stream and the microphone-captured audio from each device. The algorithm implements several sophisticated techniques:

**Preprocessing Pipeline**: Raw audio from both the reference stream and microphone capture undergoes identical preprocessing including high-pass filtering (typically 100Hz cutoff) to remove low-frequency noise, normalization to account for volume differences, and windowing to optimize correlation calculations.

**Cross-Correlation Analysis**: The system employs efficient FFT-based cross-correlation to identify the time offset between reference and captured audio. The correlation window is typically 2-5 seconds, providing sufficient data for accurate drift detection while maintaining real-time performance requirements.

**Peak Detection and Validation**: Correlation peaks are validated using multiple criteria including minimum correlation threshold (typically 0.7), peak prominence, and consistency with historical measurements. This multi-stage validation process ensures that spurious correlations due to noise or acoustic artifacts do not trigger unnecessary synchronization adjustments.

#### Adaptive Buffer Management

The buffer management system implements sophisticated algorithms that balance synchronization accuracy with system stability:

**Dynamic Offset Calculation**: Buffer offsets are calculated using a combination of current drift measurements, historical drift trends, and device-specific characteristics. The algorithm employs exponential smoothing to prevent oscillation while maintaining responsiveness to genuine drift conditions.

**Predictive Adjustment**: The system analyzes historical drift patterns to predict future drift and proactively adjust buffer offsets. This predictive capability is particularly important for devices with known drift characteristics or environmental factors that influence timing stability.

**Group Synchronization**: When multiple devices are configured in synchronization groups, the algorithm optimizes for overall group coherence rather than individual device accuracy. This approach ensures that devices within a group maintain tight synchronization even if absolute timing accuracy is slightly compromised.

### Scalability and Performance

The SyncStream architecture is designed to scale efficiently from small home installations to large commercial deployments:

#### Horizontal Scaling

The system supports horizontal scaling through multiple approaches:

**Multiple Transmitter Hosts**: Large installations can deploy multiple transmitter hosts, each managing a subset of receiver nodes. This approach distributes processing load and provides redundancy for critical applications.

**Hierarchical Synchronization**: In very large deployments, receiver nodes can be organized in hierarchical groups with intermediate synchronization points, reducing the communication overhead on the primary transmitter host.

**Load Balancing**: The MQTT broker can be configured with load balancing and clustering capabilities to handle high message volumes and provide fault tolerance.

#### Performance Optimization

Several optimization techniques ensure optimal performance across different deployment scenarios:

**Adaptive Sampling**: The system automatically adjusts drift measurement frequency based on observed stability. Stable devices require less frequent monitoring, reducing overall system load.

**Efficient Signal Processing**: All signal processing algorithms are optimized for the limited computational resources of the Raspberry Pi Zero W, using integer arithmetic where possible and implementing efficient FFT algorithms.

**Network Optimization**: MQTT message compression, intelligent batching, and adaptive quality of service selection minimize network bandwidth requirements while maintaining synchronization performance.

The architecture's modular design ensures that individual components can be upgraded or replaced without affecting overall system operation, providing a foundation for long-term system evolution and enhancement.
